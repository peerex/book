# Anchor / About

Peerex Anchor aims to bring speed, security and freedom to known crypto currencies upgrading them into Stellar assets. It makes paying with Bitcoin, Ethereum and some other currencies instant and free!

## How it works

It would be familiar to you if you'd ever used [Shapeshift](https://shapeshift.io) or [Changelly](https://changelly.com).

The act of successful converting of crypto currency into Stellar asset is called an **Upgrade**. A user creates a new request for upgrade and then given an address (and maybe some additional payment info) to send their coins to. Once the payment is completed, Peerex Anchor account transfers assets to the user's Stellar account.

The Anchor is capable of creating [Stellar accounts](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/accounts.html) and establishing [Trustlines](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/assets.html#trustlines) too, therefore a user doesn't necessary has to have an experience with Stellar. An amount of XLM needed for these operations will be deducted from the Upgrade.

## Irreversible Upgrades

Once an Upgrade is completed, Peerex doesn't have to buy the assets back. It prevents the system from crash in a case of hack or seizure. It's just like burning your coins proving that you had them, but in this case, all coins will go directly to our greedy pockets and we will buy yachts and hoes with them.

Jokes apart, an Upgrade can be considered as a win-win donation to Peerex foundation and it also proves an asset value. We will eventually send funds to support open organizations like Stellar.

## Supported crypto currencies

Peerex Anchor will only upgrade crypto currencies which have real technology value. For example, Bitcoin Cash is just a fork of Bitcoin, or ICO tokens are just Ethereum contracts, so they will not be supported.

**The list:**

* Bitcoin
* Ethereum
* Monero
* **Propose more?**

### Upgrade rates

The Anchor will transfer appropriate assets (e.g. `BTC` to `BTC` asset)  with 1:1 rate. Moreover, we're looking into converting crypto currencies to [native Stellar lumens](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/) or fiat assets (e.g. `USD`) with average major exchanges' rates.

## Referrals

Due to an ability to issue assets as much as we want, we can afford ourselves to reward users who refer other users to make an Upgrade. Referral reward is tied to an Upgrade revealing the referrer's Stellar account public key and the reward amount.

Say, if the reward is 1%, for each successful Upgrade made by a referral, referrer will be payed with 1% of the amount in target assets.
