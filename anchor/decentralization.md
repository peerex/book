# Anchor / Decentralization

The main issue with major crypto-related platforms, be it an asset exchange (e.g. Poloniex, Bittrex) or local exchange (LocalBitcoins), is that **you will lose your funds once they got hacked**, seized or just having a bad mood. You're not in control of your coins.

Moreover, often a platform is regulated by a government, forcing it to deanonymize you asking for **ID** and even **implying taxes** on routine operations!

*Are you tired of that? Peerex is here for help!*

## No centralized store of your wealth

All assets you have are stored on decentralized Stellar blockchain with tons of globally-distributed nodes. So there is no any change of losing them apart from your forgetting your private key.

## Fixed value of your assets

If Peerex had a responsibility of buying its assets back, it could reduce of your assets' values in a case of system failure.

> Peerex is down, it will not buy your assets back so they are useless now!

That's why Peerex Anchor upgrades your coins in an **irreversible** manner. Once you've upgraded your Bitcoins to `BTC` assets, you can not just sell them back for the same Bitcoins. However, you are still able to trade your assets on **any** Stellar Exchange (including [Peerex Asset Exchange](/asset_exchange/README.md)) for another assets or [Stellar lumens](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/); or sell them via [Peerex Local Exchange](/local_exchange/README.md).

  Always remember that everyone on Stellar can issue his own <a href="https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/assets.html">asset</a> and you can trade your Peerex assets to anything else.

## No centralized control of your identity

Peerex does not need your ID or e-mail or anything else. You can buy, sell and exchange assets and even accept payments while staying anonymous. Remember that paying taxes is your responsibility though.
