# Asset Exchange / About

Peerex Asset Exchange is a client-side Javascript implementation of [Stellar Distributed Exchange](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/exchange.html) and it may be similar to classic exchanges you're used to (e.g. Poloniex, Kraken), except the fact that it is:

* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> Decentralized - you're in a full control of your funds
* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> Anonymous - we never know who you are ([read more](/overview/privacy.md))
* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> Absolutely free (apart from extra low [Stellar fees](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/fees.html))

You can trade [Peerex Assets](/anchor/README.md), [Stellar Lumens](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/) or any other assets while staying secure and anonymous. Moreover, you are not limited to Peerex Asset Exchange! You're in a full control of your funds and you can trade on any other Stellar exchange.
