## Decentralization

Our aim is to create a truly decentralized product independent from any government. Unlike other products claiming they will eventually become decentralized in the future, we can do it today - thanks to [Stellar](https://stellar.org). Which results in, even if our services are down or hacked or we run away, nothing breaks and nobody looses a penny.

## Privacy

None of our services collect any sensitive data from you (except IP). No analytics, fingerprinting or third-party cookies. Ever.

## Transparency

We're aiming to be as much transparent as possible. All operations, history, transactions are publicly accessible. All client-side code is [open-sourced](https://github.com/peerex).

## Wallet

Peerex Wallet is an open-source Javascript application which runs inside your browser or on your Desktop. It is absolutely secure due to the fact that no authentication data is ever passed to our servers.

## Anchor

Peerex Anchor is a service which upgrades crypto currency into Stellar assets, e.g. Bitcoin into BTC with 1:1 rate. It is also capable of creating and funding a Stellar account for you.

## Assets Exchange

Peerex Assets Exchange is another open-source Javascript application implementing [Stellar Distributed Exchange](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/exchange.html). It allows to trade any assets, be it BTC, USD, Google Stocks or your friend Bob's Banana Tokens. And it's absolutely **free** and anonymous.

## Local Exchange

Peerex Local Exchange is a service allowing to securely exchange assets off-chain, for example, buying BTC with PayPal, while staying anonymous. Such exchanges are made between real people or APIs, not Peerex itself. This service is totally **free** too.

## Payments Platform

Peerex Payment Platform allows merchants to communicate with another users of both Assets Exchange and Local Exchange via programmatic interfaces (APIs) for **free** as well. As a result, a merchant will be able to anonymously accept any digital assets or fiat (e.g. debit card) as a payment option *globally* and receive funds *directly* into their secure wallet.

The platform includes such tools as payment pages, button and integrations.
