# Privacy

Peerex takes your privacy seriously.

## NoKYC (Do Not Know Your Client)

We never know neither your e-mail nor ID, because there is no such thing as "registration".

## No tracking

We never track your browser with neither our or third-party cookies nor scripts. No Google analytics, no even self-hosted tracking. And, of course, Peerex doesn't [fingerprint](https://panopticlick.eff.org/) your browser.

These claims can easily be verified because 100% of our client-side code is open-source.

## IP logging

> We never log your IP. We also don't replicate or backup our Database, so it's all ephemeral.

Do you believe such claims? You must not.

### We know <i class="fa fa-hand-paper-o"></i>

The truth is, any web-server in the internet knows your IP. Even if doesn't log it, in case of server breach, an attacker will able to see incoming requests' IP addresses.

We can say that we do not log your IP, but can you trust us? And even if so, what happens if an attacker silently captures our servers and we couldn't warn you in time? They will be able to see all incoming requests' IP; moreover, each Stellar Node and our ISP (hosting company which connects out servers to the internet) always know your IP too.

That's why we <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle warn"></i> **do log your IP address** when you make a request to our back-end. Moreover, we will **expose it** publicly to prevent surprises if the servers are attacked (read more about exposing at [Transparency Page](/overview/transparency.md)).

List of elements which expose your IP:

* <i class="fa fa-book"></i> [Local Exchange](/local_exchange/privacy.md)

Be warned.
