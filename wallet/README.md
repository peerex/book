# Peerex Wallet

Peerex Wallet is another client-side [open-source](https://github.com/peerex/wallet) Stellar wallet implementation, which allows to perform almost any Stellar operation, including:

* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> Creating a new account
* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> Making payments
* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> Managing [assets](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/assets.html)
* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> **Issuing your own tokens**
* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> Setting up trustlines ([what is trustline?](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/assets.html#trustlines))
* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> Signing transactions as well as any plain data

Your Stellar private key never leaves your browser. Additionally, for a better user experience, it can be stored in a browser's [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) in encrypted state, so only a browser-specific PIN of your choice can decrypt it.

The Wallet does not have any additional [Decentralization](/overview/decentralization.md), [Privacy](/overview/privacy.md) or [Transparency](/overview/transparency.md) notes apart from standard ones.

**In a nutshell:**

* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> There are no any additional scripts in the Wallet which could track your activity
* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> Your IP is not logged anywhere because there is no Wallet Back-end
* <i class="fa fa-check success"></i> The Wallet is [open-sourced](https://github.com/peerex/wallet), so you can verify any claim made on this page
